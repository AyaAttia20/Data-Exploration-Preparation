# Data Exploration & Preparation Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analysis and preprocessing notebooks created as part of various data exploration projects. Each notebook tackles a different dataset and explores important insights using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📁 Contents

### 1. Web_Scraping_ITI_Projects
A notebook demonstrating web scraping techniques to collect and analyze data from the web. It includes:
- Using libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`.
- Cleaning and structuring scraped data for analysis.

### 2. Population_dataset.ipynb
An analysis of population trends across different countries and years. This project includes:
- Handling missing values and inconsistent data.
- Visualizing population growth and distribution.

### 3. day_wise_Covid_19_data.ipynb
Time-series analysis of global COVID-19 data. Key features:
- Trend analysis of confirmed, recovered, and death cases.
- Identifying patterns and anomalies in the pandemic data.

### 4. preferred__American_university_dataset.ipynb
Exploratory Data Analysis on preferences for American universities. Topics covered:
- Analyzing student demographics and preferences.
- Visualization of trends and correlations.
